# Toman Bike Shop Analysis Report (SQL & Power BI)
## Database Analysis Report for Toman Bike Shop

### Goal:
This analysis will decide whether Toman Bike Shop will hike their prices this coming year using the available data of bike rentals and their price sensitivity. We used SQL and Power BI to analyze the revenue trends, customer segments, and seasonal demand in order to understand what impact a price increase will have on ridership, profits, and revenues.

### Database Insights:

1. **Seasonal Trends:**
Besides, rentals also reflect a very strong seasonal demand cycle, peaking in summer and holiday months, with low returns in the lean months, though residual activities due to their daily commutation needs are not uncommon.

2. **Customer Segmentation**:
Most users are young, 20-35-year-old city dwellers; they use the service to go to work and for leisure. This category is less sensitive to price, uses the service more frequently, and especially uses mountain and electric bikes.

3. **Revenue Trends:**
Current pricing strategies ensure a consistent revenue level throughout the peak seasons. However, from the data obtained, even in previous slight price increases, demand was almost equal. This suggests that some leeway may be allowed for price increases without seriously affecting the rental volumes.

4. **Price Elasticity**:
Elastic price analysis indicates that riders are not responsive to small increases in prices. In those situations where the price increased 5-10%, rental activity either showed no decline or showed minimal decline. The customer is consistent with their use of the service-in particular, bike renters of mid-to-higher level bikes-despite the change in pricing.


### Recommendations:

1. **Apply a Reasonable Price Increment:** With this price elasticity in mind, a modest price increase of 5-10% can be done during peak seasons, summer, and holidays. This will keep demand maximized while volumes remain stable during that time. During off-peak hours, prices can remain flat or be slightly discounted to maintain the ridership of cost-conscious riders.

2. **Price targeting in Premium bikes**: The electric and mountain bikes are most attractive to younger, urban riders who are relatively price insensitive. However, pricing each of these two bike types 10-15% higher will significantly enhance profit without deterring regular riders. The price of the standard bike would not be adjusted to prevent deterring budget-conscious customers.

3. **Seasonal Pricing Strategy**: Toman Bike Share should consider dynamic pricing to maximize revenue throughout the year. This can allow higher pricing during summer and holiday periods to maximize revenue, while special promotions or discounts given during the off-peak months can help to keep interest in riding and consistent usage of the bikes.

4. **Customer Loyalty Programs**: In this regard, to offset this possible concern with the price-sensitive customers, introduce a loyalty or subscription program that discounts frequent users or special rates for extended use. This encourages long-term customer retention even at higher prices. 

5. **Price to Better the Service**: Any price increase should be justified by enhanced services. These could include the fact that the bikes are better maintained, the service area is expanded, or there are added benefits like bettered customer support. Marketing these improvements in tandem with the price adjustments would smooth out the positive customer experience and dampen negative reactions to increased costs. 

### Conclusion: 
By applying dynamic pricing, in particular, to peak hours, Toman Bike Share can increase its pricing next year without significantly decreasing the number of riders. In this light, the company should seek an effective balance of dynamic pricing along with customer loyalty programs that would add to the revenues and profits while maintaining a good customer base. Pricing must be flexible enough to accommodate all market conditions and customer preferences.
